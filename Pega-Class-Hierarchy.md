Pega Platform facilitates rule reuse between case types and applications. Developers often use rules, from single data elements to entire processes in applications. **Rule reuse improves application quality and reduces development time.**

## !Remember Within an application, Pega Platform groups rules into classes according to their capacity for reuse

**Each grouping is a class**
**Each Application consist of Three Class types:**

1. The **Work class** contains the rules that describe how to process cases such as:
  **- Data Elements**
  **- User Interfaces**
  **- Processes**

2. The **Intergration class** contains the rules that describes how the application interacts with other systems such as the assets that connect the application to a database or a third-party web server.

3. The **Data class** contains the rules that describe the data types in the application ie. customer data types, or order items.

**Note: When you create a rule in App Studio, the application identifies the appropriate class for you.**
