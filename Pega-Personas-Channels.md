# Pega - Personas, Channels, Users

## Personas

**Personas - is the business representation of a type of user.**
Personas allow the organization to identify unique needs for application users, which could include different user interfaces to meet those needs. For example, an organization may define a persona to represent a technician, who needs a user interface that supports performing service tasks.

### Creating a New Persona

In App Studio add a new persona by clicking
**Users > User Management** and adding a **persona in the Persona tab**.Once the new persona is created, you can then assign it to users, as well as further configure the application to meet the persona's needs.

Create additional personas when a unique combination of channel interface, responsibilities, permissions, and work routing requires differentiation from an existing persona.
